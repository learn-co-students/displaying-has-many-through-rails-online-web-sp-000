#We can set up a many-to-many relationship using a join table. In this case, comments will act as our join table. Any table that contains two foreign keys can be thought of as a join table. A row in our comments table will look something like this:
# id	     content	     post_id	user_id
# 1	 "I loved this post!"	5	      3

#For this instance, we know that the Comment with an ID of 1 was created by the User with an ID of 3 for the Post with an ID of 5
